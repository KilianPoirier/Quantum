# Solving Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) problems using QAOA on Azure Quantum

This sample shows how to solve quadratic unconstrained binary optimization problems using the Recursive Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (RQAOA) on the Azure Quantum service. It demonstrate how to operate the RQAOA workflow for a general QUBO problem that can be taylored to more specific case like graph coloring or minimum vertex cover.

## Manifest

- [RQAOA-introduction.ipynb](./RQAOA-introduction.ipynb) Python notebook demonstrating how to run RQAOA locally and on the Azure Quantum platform using the OpenQAOA package.
