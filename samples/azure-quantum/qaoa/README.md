# Solving Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) problems using QAOA on Azure Quantum

This sample shows how to solve quadratic unconstrained binary optimization problems using the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) on the Azure Quantum service. It demonstrates how to operate the QAOA workflow for a specific problem instance (TO SPECIFY) as well as a general QUBO problem that can be taylored to more specific cases like graph coloring or minimum vertex cover.
